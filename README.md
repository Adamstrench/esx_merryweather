# esx_merryweather
Modified esx_holdup script so credits to Jérémie N'gadi for his work.

I know this script is messy with the edits, it's my first release so be nice!

The `main.lua` file the `esx_merryweather/server` directory rewards items based on a chance (1-100), the items within this script may not be available on your server, in which case you'll have to go to line 80 and change the items there.
